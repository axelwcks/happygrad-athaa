    <h2>♡ to the one who feels like spring ♡</h2>
    <h3>....even on my winters</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>
       i don’t always say it out loud, but i notice the way your heart moves — how deep you feel, even in silence. you love like poetry, and i swear, sometimes it feels like you are one.
      </p>
      <p>
       i know your mind drifts into daydreams — alternate worlds, late-night thoughts, playlists with hidden meanings. and somehow, you always make me feel part of those dreams. i hope you know that i treasure being in them.
       </p>
       <p>
       you don’t shout your love — you show it. in the tiniest, most delicate ways: a song, a glance, a quiet presence. you love with subtlety, but every bit of it lands loud in me.
       </p>
       <h2>
       and when things get hard, i promise to meet you gently. no pressure, no fixing — just soft space to breathe, speak, feel.
       </h2>
       <p>
       i see how you’re always figuring yourself out, turning questions into constellations. i’ll never hold you back from that — your becoming is something i’ll always root for.
       </p>
       <p>
       if we ever run out of words, let’s find them in music, books, or quiet moments. because you and i… we don’t need noise to be loud.
       </p>
       <p>
       just know, i’m not here for the version of you you think i want — i’m here for the version you really are.
       </p>
       <p>
       thank you for letting me in.
</p>
<p>– sincerely yours,</p>
<p>- kak axel</p>
